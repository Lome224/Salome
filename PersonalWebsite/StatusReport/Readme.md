### What have you done for your project so far?
This project comes a lot with self-learning. I coded the basic layout for my project: Homepage. I started learning how to use Bootstrap 5 and implemented the code to my program. Additionally, I found out a program called Font Awesome it provides icons and fonts to make the website more attractive.

### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet let the website fully run. I have not made the two tabs fully functional or put my works into them. My plan is to let my homepage branch into two categories: works with video media and works without visual media. Then, I also want to attach my resum√© at a single tab. 

### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My main concern is how to make the website more visually appealing: organizing my portfolio so that the items have the same size and finding an effective way to organize my .wav files. Also, I hope to incorporate some graphic designs, but I do not know how to code them.

I am also figuring out how to attach my resume to my website.

I also do not know how to make a URL link using my name so other users could access it. Currently, I only have the HTML code.
