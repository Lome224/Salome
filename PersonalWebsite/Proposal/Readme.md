# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Salome's Personal Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

I want to create my own website containing my composition porfolio and my customized design

## Detail your project in a paragraph or more. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will exhibit my works chronologically as well as categorize them into different genres and venues. For instance, orchestral works with live video recordings will be in one category, while mockups will have a separate tab. I hope users will be able to interact with the website. For example, by clicking the treble clef icon, they will be directed to my orchestral work; if they click the camera icon, they will be directed to my film scoring portfolio.

## If you plan to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? Which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than expected. And it is common to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what **WILL** you accomplish no matter what?

I will have my portfolio being catalogued and a basic layout will be made.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you **THINK** you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The basic layout is made as well as containing multiple tabs so this way my works could be catalogued more oraganized.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a **BEST** outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The ideal part is that I will have the full feature implemented, and it artistically pleasing.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

First, I need to work on my ability to code in html better. I will research best practices for creating tabbed navigation menus, including how to structure HTML for accessibility, style tabs using CSS for a clean and responsive design. If I have more time, I hope to explore Java for interactivity when it comes to managing tab switching. Additionally, I will explore advanced topics such as ARIA roles for accessibility, responsive design techniques to ensure the tabs work well on different devices, and performance optimization to maintain a smooth user experience.
